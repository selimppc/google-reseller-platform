This is an excellent step. Building a custom Laravel application to manage your reselling business is the ultimate way to automate operations and provide a seamless customer experience.

I cannot write the entire application code for you, as a "complete production system" is a significant software development project that would take a professional developer weeks or months to build.

However, I can provide you with something just as valuable: a complete architectural blueprint and development roadmap. You can use this blueprint to build the system yourself if you are a developer, or hand it over to a freelance Laravel developer or an agency to build it for you.

This plan is tailored for a business operating in Bangladesh.

Project: Laravel Google Workspace Reseller Platform

1. Core Technology Stack

Framework: Laravel 11+ (the latest stable version).

Frontend: Laravel Blade with Livewire. This combination is perfect for creating dynamic, interactive interfaces (like dashboards and forms) without the complexity of a full JavaScript framework like Vue or React.

Database: MySQL 8+ or PostgreSQL 15+.

Server: A Virtual Private Server (VPS) from DigitalOcean, Linode, or AWS, running Ubuntu with the Nginx web server.

Payment Gateway Integration:

Primary (for Bangladesh): SSLCOMMERZ or aamarPay. These are essential for accepting payments via local cards, bKash, Nagad, Rocket, and bank transfers.

Secondary (for International): Stripe. If you plan to have international clients or want a more developer-friendly API for credit card processing. We will focus the logic on the local gateways.

Deployment: Laravel Forge for server provisioning and deployment automation is highly recommended to simplify server management.

2. Database Schema Design

This is the foundation of your application. Here are the essential database tables you'll need:

users: Standard Laravel table. We'll add a role column.

id, name, email, password, role ('admin', 'customer'), company_id (foreign key)

companies: To group users from the same client company.

id, name, billing_address, contact_email, contact_phone

plans: Your service packages.

id, name (e.g., "Business Starter"), slug (e.g., "business-starter"), price_monthly, price_annually, google_workspace_sku (e.g., "Google-Apps-For-Business"), features (JSON column to list features like "30 GB Storage", "Bangla Support").

subscriptions: The core of the billing system. Links a company to a plan.

id, company_id, plan_id, status ('active', 'pending_payment', 'cancelled', 'trial'), trial_ends_at, billing_cycle ('monthly', 'annually'), next_payment_date.

invoices: Tracks every payment attempt.

id, subscription_id, company_id, amount, status ('paid', 'pending', 'failed'), due_date, paid_at, payment_gateway_ref (the transaction ID from SSLCOMMERZ).

google_workspace_instances: To track the provisioning status for each customer.

id, company_id, google_customer_id (this is the ID from the Partner Sales Console), domain_name, status ('pending_provisioning', 'active', 'suspended').

support_tickets: A simple support system.

id, user_id, subject, message, status ('open', 'closed', 'awaiting_reply').

3. System Features & Architecture

We'll break the system into three main parts:

A. Customer-Facing Website & Checkout

Homepage: Professional landing page explaining your services.

Pricing Page:

Dynamically lists all plans from the database.

Shows monthly and annual pricing. A toggle can switch between them.

"Choose Plan" button on each plan.

Checkout Process (Multi-step form):

Step 1: User clicks "Choose Plan". They are taken to a registration page.

Step 2: They enter their details (name, email, password) and their company details (company_name, phone). This creates a user and a company.

Step 3: They are redirected to the selected Payment Gateway (SSLCOMMERZ) to complete the payment. A subscription and an invoice are created with pending status.

Payment Gateway Callback:

You will have a dedicated route (e.g., /webhooks/payment-callback) that SSLCOMMERZ calls after a payment is made.

This is CRITICAL: This route's controller will verify the transaction was successful, update the invoice status to paid, and the subscription status to active.

It will also create a google_workspace_instance record with a status of pending_provisioning.

Finally, it will log the user into their new dashboard and send a welcome email.

B. Customer Portal (After Login)

This is the dashboard for your paying customers.

Dashboard:

Welcome message.

Displays their current plan (subscription->plan->name).

Shows the status (subscription->status).

Shows the next billing date (subscription->next_payment_date).

Quick link to "Request Support".

Subscription Management:

View current plan details.

Option to upgrade/downgrade (this would calculate pro-rated costs).

Option to cancel the subscription.

Billing History:

A table listing all past invoices.

Shows status (paid, failed).

Button to download invoices as PDFs (you can use a package like laravel-dompdf).

User Management (Simplified):

A simple form to "Request New User" or "Request User Deletion".

This creates a task for the admin, not direct integration with Google's API, which is safer to start.

Support Center:

Open a new support_ticket.

View the status and replies to existing tickets.

C. Admin Dashboard (Your Control Center)

This is where you run your business.

Main Dashboard:

Key metrics: Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), active customers, new sign-ups this month, open support tickets.

Customer Management:

A searchable list of all companies and users.

View a customer's profile, subscription, and billing history.

Provisioning Queue:

A dedicated page showing all google_workspace_instances with pending_provisioning status.

For each entry, it shows the customer's company name and domain.

You, the admin, will manually provision the account in the Google Partner Sales Console.

You then come back here, enter the google_customer_id you received from Google, and change the status to active. This triggers an email to the customer with their login details.

Subscription Management (Admin):

View all subscriptions.

Manually pause, cancel, or change a customer's subscription.

Plan Management:

Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for your plans. This allows you to change pricing or add new packages without changing code.

Support Ticket Management:

View and reply to all customer support_tickets.

4. Recurring Billing Logic

This is the heart of the automation.

Create a Laravel Scheduled Task: You will create a custom Artisan command (e.g., php artisan billing:process).

Schedule the Command: In app/Console/Kernel.php, you will schedule this command to run once every day.

PHP
$schedule->command('billing:process')->daily();
The Command's Logic: The command will:

Query for all subscriptions where next_payment_date is today.

For each subscription found, it will generate a new invoice with a pending status.

It will then send an email to the customer with a link to pay for this new invoice.

The payment link takes them to your website's payment page, which redirects to SSLCOMMERZ. The same callback logic from the initial checkout applies.

Development Roadmap

Phase 1 (Foundation): Setup new Laravel project, configure database, implement authentication (Laravel Breeze), and create the database migrations for all the tables listed above. Build the Admin-only Plan Management CRUD.

Phase 2 (Checkout & Payments): Build the public pricing page and the multi-step checkout form. Integrate SSLCOMMERZ for the initial payment and build the critical webhook handler.

Phase 3 (Customer Portal): Build the customer dashboard, billing history page, and support ticket system.

Phase 4 (Admin & Provisioning): Build the full Admin Dashboard, especially the Customer Management and the Provisioning Queue.

Phase 5 (Automation & Deployment): Implement the recurring billing scheduled command. Set up the production server, configure Laravel Forge for deployment, and conduct thorough end-to-end testing, especially for all payment scenarios.

This blueprint provides a complete and professional structure for your project. Given the complexity, especially around billing and security, I strongly recommend hiring an experienced Laravel developer if you are not one yourself. This is a real, mission-critical application, and it's worth investing in to get it right.
