Running a business as a Google Workspace reseller where you handle customer billing directly is a very common and profitable model. This model is officially known as the "Sell" engagement model within the Google Cloud Partner Advantage program.

Here is a comprehensive step-by-step guide on how to set up and run this business, tailored with considerations for operating in Bangladesh.

Phase 1: Becoming an Official Google Cloud Partner

You cannot simply start reselling Google Workspace. You must first be accepted into Google's official partner program.

Step 1: Join the Google Cloud Partner Advantage Program

This is the mandatory first step. The program provides you with the tools, training, and credentials necessary to sell and manage Google products.

Go to the Google Cloud Partner Advantage website: Search for "Google Cloud Partner Advantage" and navigate to their official page.

Apply to Join: You will need to fill out an application form. This will require details about your company, such as its legal name, website, and business model. You'll need a registered business entity.

Choose the "Sell" Engagement Model: During the application, you'll be asked to choose your primary engagement model. You must select "Sell". This model is specifically for partners who want to handle the entire customer relationship, including billing.

Step 2: Meet the Program Requirements

Google has basic requirements for its partners, which include:

A Registered Business: You need a legally registered company in Bangladesh (e.g., a Limited Company, Partnership, or Sole Proprietorship with a Trade License).

A Professional Website: Your company website must be live and clearly state the services you offer.

Business Plan: Be prepared to articulate your business plan, including your target market and sales strategy.

Phase 2: Setting Up Your Reseller Operations

Once you are accepted into the program, you gain access to the tools needed to operate your business.

Step 3: Access and Learn the Partner Sales Console

This is your command center. The Partner Sales Console is a web-based portal where you will:

Provision new customer accounts: Create new Google Workspace accounts for your clients.

Manage existing customers: Add/remove users, upgrade/downgrade plans.

Manage billing: See your wholesale costs from Google.

Access support: Get technical and sales support from Google.

You must become very familiar with this tool. Google provides training and documentation for partners.

Step 4: Define Your Service Packages and Pricing

This is where you create the "packages" your customers will buy. You are not just selling a Google Workspace license; you are selling a complete solution.

Base Price: Google will bill you a wholesale (discounted) price for each license. Your retail price to your customer must be higher than this wholesale price to make a profit.

Example: Google charges you $5 USD per user/month for Business Starter. You might charge your customer ৳700 BDT (approx. $6 USD) per user/month.

Value-Added Services: This is how successful resellers differentiate themselves and increase their profit margins. Your packages should bundle the license with your own services, such as:

Setup and Migration: Migrating emails, contacts, and calendars from old systems (like cPanel, Zoho, or Microsoft 365).

Onboarding and Training: Training for your client's employees on how to use Gmail, Drive, Meet, etc.

Admin Support: Acting as their outsourced Google Workspace administrator.

Local Language Support: Providing support in Bangla, which is a significant advantage over buying directly from Google.

Custom Domain & DNS Management: Handling the technical setup of MX, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records.

Example Packages:

Basic Package: Google Workspace License + Domain DNS Setup.

Business Package: License + Setup + Email Migration for up to 5 users.

Premium Package: License + Setup + Migration + Admin Training + Priority Phone Support in Bangla.

Step 5: Set Up Your Billing and Payment System

This is the core of your question: "customers will buy packages via my payment and they will pay to me".

Website/E-commerce Storefront: You need a place for customers to see your packages and place an order. This can be a simple page on your business website with a contact form or a full e-commerce setup.

Payment Gateway: You need a way to accept payments online in Bangladesh. Popular options include:

Local: aamarPay, SSLCOMMERZ, Portwallet (These can process local cards, MFS like bKash, Nagad, Rocket, etc.).

International: Stripe, 2Checkout, or PayPal (if your business structure allows).

Invoicing System: You will need software to create and send professional invoices to your clients for monthly or annual payments. Many accounting software options like Zoho Books, QuickBooks, or local solutions can handle this.

Phase 3: The Business Workflow (How it Works in Practice)

Here is the end-to-end flow for a single customer:

Marketing: A potential customer in Dhaka finds your website advertising "Google Workspace with local support in Bangladesh."

Sales: They contact you. You discuss their needs and recommend your "Business Package" for 10 users at ৳8,000 BDT per month. They agree.

Payment: You send them an invoice or a payment link via your payment gateway. They pay you ৳8,000 BDT directly.

Provisioning:

You log into your Google Partner Sales Console.

You create a new Google Workspace account for your customer's domain (e.g., customer-company.com).

You add 10 user licenses (Business Standard plan) to their account.

Onboarding:

You provide the customer with their new super admin login credentials.

You guide them through verifying their domain and configuring the MX records to start receiving emails.

You perform the migration and training services included in your package.

Billing Cycle (The Financial Flow):

You get paid by the customer: The customer pays you ৳8,000 BDT every month.

You pay Google: At the end of the billing cycle, Google sends you a single consolidated invoice for all the licenses you manage for all your customers. Let's say the wholesale cost for those 10 licenses is $50 USD. You pay this invoice to Google in USD.

Your Profit: Your gross profit for this customer is (৳8,000 BDT) - (Cost of $50 USD in BDT). You are responsible for managing the currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Key Considerations for Bangladesh

Pricing in BDT: Always price your services in Bangladeshi Taka (BDT). This makes it simple for local businesses. However, your cost from Google will be in USD, so you must factor in currency conversion rates and potential fluctuations when setting your prices.

Local Support is Your Superpower: Emphasize that you offer support in Bangla during local business hours. This is a massive selling point that Google cannot offer directly to smaller clients.

Target Market: Focus on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Bangladesh. Many are looking to professionalize their operations and move away from free email addresses or less reliable hosting.

Compliance: Ensure your business complies with all local regulations, including VAT and other taxes on the services you provide.

By following this model, you build a sustainable business where you own the customer relationship, control your pricing and packages, and add significant value beyond what Google offers directly.
