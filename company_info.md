Primary Engagement Model with Google Cloud:

Select: Sell

Justification (Why did you choose 'Sell'?): "We have chosen the 'Sell' engagement model because our business strategy is centered on owning the complete customer relationship. We will manage the entire lifecycle, from initial sales and technical onboarding to recurring billing and first-line support.

Which Google Workspace versions will you focus on? "Our primary focus will be on Google Workspace Business Starter, Business Standard, and Business Plus, as these plans are best suited to the needs and budgets of our target SME clients in Bangladesh."

Example Answer: "Digital Ascent BD adds unique value to the Google ecosystem by targeting the underserved SME sector in Bangladesh. Our key differentiators are:

Localized Billing: We handle all billing in Bangladeshi Taka (BDT), removing currency exchange complexities for clients.

Expert Bangla Support: We provide technical and administrative support in the local language (Bangla), making the technology accessible to a wider audience.

Hands-On Migration & Onboarding: We offer complete migration services from legacy email systems (cPanel, Zoho, etc.) and provide on-site or remote training to ensure high user adoption.

Market Penetration: Our established local network and digital marketing strategies are specifically designed to reach and convert Bangladeshi business owners who are not yet on a professional productivity platform."

Target Customer Profile:

Example Answer: "Our ideal customers are Bangladeshi SMEs with 5 to 100 employees.
